CannyEdgeSingle.py --> File contain canny edge algorithm for single image. It uses OpenCV library.
Try this new algo I just updated 16:41pm 02/05/2021. 

CannyEdgeMultipleImg.py --> File contain Canny Edge Algorithm for multiple images. It does not use OpenCV.
                            It is an proper step by step algorithm implementation. It will take some time to run because
                            it alter image step by step in 4 phases as the algo is. Last image is output that we needed.
